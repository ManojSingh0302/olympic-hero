### Project Overview

 The Olympic Games, considered to be the world's foremost sports competition has more than 200 nations participating across the Summer and Winter Games alternating by occurring every four years but two years apart.
Throughout this project, we will explore the Olympics dataset(scraped from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All-time_Olympic_Games_medal_table) , look at some interesting statistics and then try to find out which country is the King of Olympic Games.


### Learnings from the project

 After completing this project, you will have a better understanding of data handling with python(pandas). In this project, you will be applying the following concepts :
- Dataframe operations 
- Conditional statement and loops
- List operations
- Bar Plotting
- Mathematical operations


### Approach taken to solve the problem

 Following are steps taken.
1)Let's start with the simple task of loading the data and do a little bit of renaming.
2)Some Countries love Summer, some Winter. We think it has to do something with their Olympic performance.For this task we will try to figure out which olympic event does a country perform better in.
3) we figured out which is a better event for each country. Let's move on to finding out the best performing countries across all events
4) Winning silver or bronze medals is a big achievement but winning gold is bigger.
Using the above created dataframe subsets, in this task let's find out which country has had the best performance with respect to the ratio between gold medals won and total medals won.
5) Winning Gold is great but is winning most gold equivalent to being the best overall perfomer? Let's find out.
